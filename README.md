## Structure Using C Programming
Structure in C programming is a **collection of multiple variables of different types**. Structures are used to create user-defined data types as a collection of other data types.

**Keyword struct**: The keyword struct is used _at the beginning while defining a structure in C._

**myStruct**: This is the name of the structure which is specified after the keyword **struct**.

**data_Type**: The data type indicates _the type of data members of the structure_. _A structure can have data members of different data types_.

**Structure_members**: This is the name of _the data member of the structure_. _Any number of data members can be defined inside a structure_. Each data member is allocated a separate space in the memory.
